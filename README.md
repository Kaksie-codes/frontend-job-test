E-commerce Dashboard
This project demonstrates the ability to build a modern e-commerce dashboard using Next.js, TypeScript, Redux (Redux Toolkit), and Tailwind CSS. The dashboard includes features like product management, a paginated product table, shopping cart functionality, and responsive design.

Tech Stack
1. Next.js 15: A React framework for building fast, scalable web applications with features like server-side rendering and static site generation.
2. TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type safety, improving development productivity and reducing errors.
3. Redux (Redux Toolkit): A state management library for JavaScript applications, helping to manage and centralize the app's state globally with an efficient and predictable flow.
4. Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid styling of elements, ensuring a responsive and customizable UI with minimal custom CSS.
5. ShadCN: A library of high-quality UI components built on top of Tailwind CSS, providing ready-to-use components like modals, buttons, and dropdowns.
6. Framer-motion: A powerful library for creating smooth, interactive animations in React applications, enhancing user experience with transitions and effects.
7. Git: A distributed version control system to track changes in the source code, facilitating collaboration and maintaining a history of the project's progress.

Features
1. Product Management Dashboard
Displays a main dashboard view showing product analytics.
Includes an interactive widget displaying key metrics (e.g., sales overview, top products).
Designed to be responsive and user-friendly for a seamless experience.
2. Product Table
Displays products in a paginated table with 10 items per page.

The cart state persists across page refreshes to ensure a seamless user experience.
4. State Management
Uses Redux for state management, with actions and reducers to manage product data and cart states.
Handles loading and error states appropriately.
